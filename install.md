## Tasks

### Installing Git

Make sure you have the Git command line binaries installed on your machine.  Find on your flavor of Linux below and issue the proper commands.

If you need more detailed instructions, or your OS isn't listed here, have a look at http://git-scm.com/download

#### Install on Ubuntu
```console
$ sudo apt-get -y install git-all
```

#### Install on CentOS
```console
$ sudo yum -y install git-all
```

#### Install on Windows
Head over to http://git-scm.com/download/win and download the windows command line client.  

Another option is to install the GitHub GUI, which contains the command line version under the hood.  Head over to https://desktop.github.com/ to download that client.
